# **Tetris-SDL-C**
---
A simple game using SDL and C as a project homework of one of my class.

## **Install**
---
I will wirte a makefile after I learned it. But now It seems like you can just use mingw-gcc to compile it...
If you are using windows, you just need to download:
> [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org/)
> [SDL2_ttf](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf)
> mingw-gcc
and then run the compile.bat.
